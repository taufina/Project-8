# Project 8
 SQL Library Manager
This is a library manager where you can view, add, update and delete book details.

To view this project, you can download or clone the project files using terminal.  Then go to the project directory and run npm install to install dependencies.  Type npm start to start the node application, and go to localhost:3000. 

Extra Credit:
I added pagination where you can click buttons to go to selected page.

I added a search box that can be used to find specific books.  

I changed the background photo.

I added a self-help book.
